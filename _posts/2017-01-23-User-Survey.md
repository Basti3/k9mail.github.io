In 2014 [Julia Korbut](http://www.julia.io) created a [design concept for K-9 Mail](http://www.julia.io/works/k-9/index.html) using [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/).

Since then we're determined to modernize and optimize both the user interface and the user experience.
In order to approach this task in a systematic way Julia created a short user survey to gather feedback from you, the users of the app.  
Please help us by participating. It shouldn't take longer than 3-5 minutes to complete.
