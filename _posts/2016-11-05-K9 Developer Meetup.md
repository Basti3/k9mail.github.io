There was a developer meet-up <a href="https://c-base.org/">c-base</a> on 4th November.

As an internationally diverse team, K-9 members do not often meet-up physically, mostly using remote working tools to organise the project. However schedules meant that <a href="http://www.github.com/cketti">cketti</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/philipwhiuk">philipwhiuk</a> were able to arrange a meet-up in Berlin this week - following on from previous meet-ups and hackathons between cketti and <a href="http://www.github.com/Valodim">Valodim</a> earlier this year.

The host organisation, <strong>c-base</strong> provides a group space for computer software, hardware and networking and has previously hosted events for organisations like the Chaos Computer Club, Wikipedia and the Freifung wireless community.
