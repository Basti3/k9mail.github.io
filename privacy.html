      <p class="text-slate"><strong>Read/modify your Contacts</strong></p>
        <p class="text-slate">The names and email addresses in the user's address book (contacts) are used to provide suggestions and auto-complete recipients when composing a message.</p>
        <p class="text-slate"><strong>Read from/write to Storage (Photos/Media/Files)</strong></p>
        <p class="text-slate">The storage area is used to save attachments or export app settings. It can also be used to import app settings or select files to attach to a message the user is composing.</p>
