## Initial Set-Up / Welcome Screen

When you first launch K-9 you will be shown a welcome screen giving you a 
run down of the features. Clicking 'Next' allows you to <a href="/docs/accounts/add">add an account</a>. Alternatively if you have previously saved settings you can <a href="/docs/settings/import_export">import them</a>.
