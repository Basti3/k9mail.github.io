# Works with K-9

Many other Android applications build on K-9's functionality.
Searching for K-9 on Google Play will turn up lots of things; 
here are some of the more useful-looking ones.

Security / Encryption:

* [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/) - End-to-end email encryption with the OpenPGP standard

Widgets:

* [Email Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.foobarsoft.emailwidget) - Fancy mail preview and count widgets (paid)
* [K-9 Mail DashClock Extension](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.cketti.dashclock.k9) - An extension for DashClock Widget to display the number of unread messages in K-9 Mail

Notification:

* [SMS, my Car and Me](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bulling.smstalk) - Reads out received emails
* [K-9 Mail for SmartWatch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.cketti.smartwatch.k9)
* [Apex Notifier](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anddoes.notifier) - Displays unread mail counter on a home screen. Also it integrates with DashClock Widget, so the unread count can be shown on the lock screen.

## Former Apps / Widgets

These apps used be part of the K-9 eco system but are now no longer available / maintained:

* *Android Privacy Guard (APG)* - Provided PGP support - replaced by OpenKeychain
* *X509Tools* - Allowed S/MIME based email encryption in K-9. Note that this application is no longer available on Google Play or supported by it's developers so may have serious unfixed vulnerabilities (Last release September 2013)
* *K-9 Data Killer* - Allowed you to manage background sync
* *MailListWidget for K-9* - Mail list preview widget
* *Email Popup* - Popup dialog notification on incoming message
* *MetaWatch Community Edition* - Displayed received emails on the watch screen, along with an unread count widget
